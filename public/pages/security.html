                    <p>Involvvely, operates the services offered on Involvvely.com (the "Involvvely Website"), including
                        the Involvvely platform (the "Involvvely Platform"), and any associated mobile applications (the
                        "Involvvely Apps") or products and services that Company may provide now or in the future
                        (collectively, the "Service").</p>
                    <p>Protecting data privacy and security is a top priority for Involvvely. Our Privacy Policy and
                        Student Data Privacy Addendum solidify the commitments that Involvvely and schools make to each
                        other, including our security and privacy commitments. Capitalized terms not defined in this
                        document, such as "Student Data", are defined in our Student Data Privacy Addendum. We regularly
                        evaluate our policies and practices to improve security and to keep up with the latest
                        practices of the security industry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Network Security</strong></p>
                    <p>The Involvvely Services use AWS, to host the infrastructure. AWS undergoes strict ongoing
                        security assessments from external audit firms to ensure compliance with security standards
                        including ISO 27001, SOC 2, PCI DSS Level 1, and FISMA. See <a
                            href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/">https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs</a>
                        for more details.</p>
                    <p><strong>Data Access Control</strong></p>
                    <p>Access to the Involvvely Services infrastructure is highly restricted. We limit access to

                        managers, and support personnel. All access to our infrastructure is logged. All access to our
                        infrastructure requires the use of strong passwords and multifactor authentication. Technical
                        and organizational measures to ensure that persons entitled to use a data processing system gain
                        access only to such Student Data in accordance with their access rights, and that Student Data
                        cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization, include:
