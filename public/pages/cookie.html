                    <p>Last updated November 30, 2020</p>
                    <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Invovvely LLC(Company, we, us, and our) uses cookies and similar
                        technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites at <a
                            href="https://involvvely.com">https://involvvely.com</a>,(Websites). It explains what these
                        technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>
                    <p>In some cases we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal
                        information if we combine it with other information.</p>
                    <p><strong>What are cookies</strong></p>
                    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a
                        website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to
                        work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
                    <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Invovvely LLC) are called first party cookies.
                        Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called third party cookies. Third party
                        cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website
                        (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third
                        party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also
                        when it visits certain other websites.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why do we use cookies?</strong></p>
                    <p>We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical
                        reasons in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as essential or strictly
                        necessary cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users
                        to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our
                        Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
                    </p>
                    <p>The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes
                        they perform are described below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary
                        depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):</p>
                    <p><strong>How can I control cookies?</strong></p>
                    <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie
                        rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager
                        allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
                        cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>
                    <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on our website. If you
                        choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality
                        and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls
                        to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web
                        browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for
                        more information.</p>

                            <p>Your browser or device may offer settings related to these technologies - visit your
                                browser or device's help menu to learn about your options (browsers for mobile devices
                                may not offer visibility). For example, you may set your browser to refuse all cookies
                                or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, changing these settings may impact
                                your use of some features or services on our Service or Website as they may
                                not function properly without cookies.</p>

                            <p>Please note that the choices described above regarding browser-based opt-outs may not

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</strong></p>
                    <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other,
                        similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called tracking pixels or
                        clear gifs). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us
                        to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This
                        allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website
                        to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
                        website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
                        performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these
                        technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair
                        their functioning.</p>
                    <p><strong>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</strong></p>
                    <p>Websites may also use so-called Flash Cookies (also known as Local Shared Objects or LSOs) to,
                        among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud
                        prevention and for other site operations.</p>
                    <p>If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your
                        Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage
                        Settings Panel <a
                            href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel
                        <a
                            href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html</a>
                        and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to
                        delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to information on the Macromedia site), how to prevent
                        Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8
                        and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page
                        you are on at the time).</p>
                    <p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may
                        reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash
                        applications used in connection with our services or online content.</p>
                    <p><strong>Do you serve targeted advertising?</strong></p>
                    <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through
                        our Websites. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites
                        in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested
                        in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements.
                        This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your
                        visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and
                        services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not
                        enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other details that directly identify
                        you unless you choose to provide these.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cookies from unregistered users</strong></p>
                    <p>We still use cookies if you donâ€™t have an account or have logged out of your account. For
                        example, if you have logged out of your account we use cookies to, for example, help you log in
                        faster the next time.</p>
                    <p>We also set cookies if you donâ€™t have a Involvvely account, but have visited involvvely.com, to
                        help us protect our Services and the people who use it from malicious activity. For example,
                        these cookies help us detect and prevent denial-of-service attacks and the mass creation of fake
                        accounts. If you have cookies on your browser or device, we read that cookie when you visit a
                        site with our app.</p>
                    <p><strong>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</strong></p>
                    <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to
                        the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore
                        re-visit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
