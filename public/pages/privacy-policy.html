                        social network (such as Facebook), your contacts on the social

                    <p>If you choose to register or log in to our services
                        using a social media account, we may have access to certain information
                        about you.</p>
                    <p>Our Services offers you the ability to register and login using your
                        third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter
                        logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile
                        information about you from your social media provider. The profile
                        Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider
                        concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
                        list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make
                        public on such social media platform.</p>
                    <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are
                        described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you
                        on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are
                        not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your
                        third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their
                        privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your
                        personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on
                        their sites and apps.</p>
                    <p><strong>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</strong></p>
                    <p>We are not responsible for the safety of any information
                        that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not
                        affiliated with, our Website.</p>
                    <p>The Services may contain advertisements from third parties that are not
                        affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services
                        or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of
                        data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third
                        parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible
                        for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any
                        third parties, including other websites, services or applications that
                        may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of
                        such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.</p>
                    <p><strong>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></p>
                    <p>We keep your information for as long as necessary to
                        fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise
                        required by law.</p>
                    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
                        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
                        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                        accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
                        require us keeping your personal information for longer than twelve (12)
                        months past the start of idle period of the user's account.</p>
                    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
                        personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
                        information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
                        personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
                        securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
                        processing until deletion is possible.</p>
                    <p><strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</strong></p>
                    <p>We aim to protect your personal information through a
                        system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
                    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security
                        measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
                        process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
                        information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
                        storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
                        promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized
                        third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly
                        collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do
                        our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
                        information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
                        access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

                        request, please use the contact details <p> provided. We

                            however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing

                            personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds
                            other than consent.</p>
                        <p>If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
                            are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
                            right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

                    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                        applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can
                        activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your
                        online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no
                        uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals
                        has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
                        signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
                        choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                        adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that

                        third parties with which we shared personal information in the

                        provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
                        identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete
