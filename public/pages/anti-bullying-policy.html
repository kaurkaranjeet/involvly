                    <h2>What is Bullying?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bullying, which includes cyberbullying, occurs when a person or group of people repeatedly
                            hurt, embarrass, or frighten another person. Cyberbullying means bullying through the use of
                            technology or any electronic communication regardless of whether the bullying occurs on or
                            off school grounds. Examples of cyberbullying include but are not limited to: text/instant
                            messaging, e-mails, creation of a webpage impersonating another person and/or other
                            electronic means through the internet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Report bullying communication or situations.</strong></p>
                    <p>When cyber bulling happens, it is important to document and report the behavior so it can be
                        addressed.</p>
                    <p>We encourage users to proactively report any bullying, harassment, or abuse that they see or
                        experience on Involvvely</p>
                    <p><strong>Steps to Take Immediately</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Don’t respond to and don’t forward cyberbullying messages.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Keep evidence of cyberbullying. Record the dates, times, and descriptions of instances
                                when cyberbullying has occurred. Save and print screenshots, emails, and text messages.
                                Use this evidence to report cyberbullying to web and cell phone service providers.</p>
